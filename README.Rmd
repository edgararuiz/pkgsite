## Intro

The goal of `pkgsite` is to make it easier to create a package website using
Quarto. It attempts to do for R what 
[Quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html) does 
for Python package documentation. 

## When should I use `pkgsite`?

In the vast majority of cases [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html)
is enough to create top tier package website. `pkgdown` is a well developed
mature package that covers all sorts of special needs. 

So apart of simply wanting a Quarto site for your R package, a couple of reasons 
to use `pkgsite` are:

- **You want to use the output 
["freeze"](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) 
capabilities in Quarto** - You would like  the examples in the help pages to
run, but, the ability to run such examples depend on specific technologies
to be accessible to where the site is being 
published, which is usually GitHub. Examples of those technologies could be
databases, Spark and Large Language Models. The idea would be to render the
website locally, where you would have access to the needed technologies, and
make commit the resulting "_freeze" folder to the repository. This will allow
any re-building of your website by GitHub to have the necessary code output to
create the HTML files.

- **You want to build a unified site** - The packages in your project may be
available in multiple languages, and wish to make a unified website. The idea
here is if you have output from *Quartodoc* from the Python side of your project,
that needs to be available in the website along with the references from the
R side of your project. 

An example of having both reasons to use `pkgsite`, is the 
[`mall`](https://github.com/mlverse/mall) package. This project has a Python, and
an R package. And the examples in both packages need an LLM in order to work, 
here is the resulting [reference pages](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/reference/).


## Installation

You can install the development version of pkgsite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgararuiz/pkgsite")
```

## Usage

In it's current state, `pkgsite`'s functions build on top of each other, in 
order to create the reference pages and the index page. The top tier function
is `write_reference()`. 

```{r}
library(pkgsite)

write_reference()
```


The function uses sensible defaults, so even by calling it without changing any 
arguments should work without errors. Internally, the function applies such
sensible values if specific arguments are left `NULL`.

## Configure via the '_quarto.yml' file

Just as with [quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html#basic-use),
`pkgsite` also supports configuration via the '_quarto.yml' file. You just need
to add a 'pkgsite' section at the top level of the yaml file. Here is an example
of the values that are available for use:

```yaml
pkgsite: 
    dir: "." # location of the package
    reference:
      dir: reference # target folder for qmd files
      template: inst/templates/_reference.qmd # reference template location
      not_run_examples: true # Flag to run the 'Not Run' examples
      index:
        file: index.qmd # name of the index file to use
        template: inst/templates/_index.qmd # template for index qmd file
```

Via the YAML file, it is also possible to create custom grouping sections for
your functions in the index file. Here is an example of how to accomplish what
is setup for this package's website:

```yaml
pkgsite: 
    dir: "."
    reference:
      dir: reference
      template: inst/templates/_reference.qmd
      not_run_examples: true
      index:
        file: index.qmd
        template: inst/templates/_index.qmd
        contents: # add 'sections' levels
          - section: Quarto file creation
            contents: 
            - write_reference.qmd
            - write_reference_index.qmd
            - write_reference_pages.qmd
          - section: Conversion functions
            contents:
            - index_to_qmd.qmd
            - rd_to_qmd.qmd
            - rd_to_list.qmd
```

The `mall` package has another example of how to configure the YAML file: 
[mall/_quarto.yml](https://github.com/mlverse/mall/blob/main/_quarto.yml#L67-L90)
