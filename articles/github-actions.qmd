title: Setting up the Github Pages site
---

If the ultimate goal is to automate the rendering and publication of the site
via Github Pages, then having a GitHub Action with the proper steps is very
necessary. 

Using the "stock" way that Quarto creates websites, will allows to avoid setting
up a more complex deployment scheme, such as using Makefiles or Docker. 

After creating up the `gh-pages` branch in your package's repository, and 
setting it up as the target for the GitHub pages, you can create the job YAML
file. Place the YAML file inside the '.github/workflows/' folder. 

Here is an example YAML file that you can use. These are the currrent steps that
this package, and `mall` use for deployment:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Render and Publish

permissions:
    contents: write
    pages: write

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```
